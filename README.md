## Example

```js
// module('my module', ['ng-q-timeout'])

foo()
.timeout(100, function (defer) {
  defer.reject('foo timed out');
  // probably run $scope.$apply here too
})
.then(function () {
  // foo has finished ok
}, function (msg) {
  // foo has failed or timed out.
});
```

Inspired by [Extending Q promises](http://dorp.io/blog/extending-q-promises.html), I have
decided to add timeout method to promises returned by the [$q](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/service/$q)
service.

## Install

`bower install ng-q-timeout`

include the script after angular

    <script src="bower_components/angular/angular.js"></script>
    <script src="ng-q-timeout.js"></script>

add `ng-q-timeout` module as a dependency to your application

    angular.module('Example', ['ng-q-timeout'])

## Limitations

Currently only the first promise returned by the `$q.defer()` is extended with `timeout` method.
Thus always set timeout first, like the example above. This will NOT work

```js
foo()
.then(...)
.timeout(100, function (defer) {
  defer.reject('foo timed out');
});
// throws an error, timeout should go before .then
```

I am using `window.setTimeout` internally, which means the timeout callback happens outside
the *$apply* loop. If you need to update the ui in the callback function, call `$scope.$apply` there.
